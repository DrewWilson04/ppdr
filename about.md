Hi! My name is Drew Wilson. 

In todays world there is no privacy, companies are alwasy trying to sneak things into their Privacy Policies.
That is where I try to help out. I read their privacy policy and bring you back a summerized chart or article about their Privacy Policy!

I hope to be able to help change privacy in this tech world.

Posts are created by me and summeries are made by me too!
